All I was getting from API, JSON format form-configs and I had to render those fields into the UI using react.

This project structure was quite a bit different than usual. Because a few domains were pointing to the same app. When an user visits x.com, in server it gets the theme for that domain and uses that in rendering, so for each domains the color scheme and fonts are different. \nI learned Remix patterns from <a href="https://kentcdodds.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="underlined">Kent C Dodds</a> and his <a href="https://epicweb.dev"target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="underlined">Epic Web Workshops</a>.
